Since December 1 2024, pub.drawpile.net no longer allows hosting sessions with the old version of Drawpile on it. That version was released over 3 years ago. Automatic reminders were sent to every session that was hosted with the old version for the past half year asking folks to tell us if there's a reason they can't update and nothing came up.

The reason we're updating is because the old version is a good bit more annoying to administer. Future versions of Drawpile also won't be infinitely backward-compatible, so administrators would need to keep a bunch of old versions around to handle reported sessions, which they don't want to do.

If pub.drawpile.net is telling you that you can't host with your old version, you can update it by installing the new version over it. You can get that <a href="https://drawpile.net/">from drawpile.net</a>.

If for some reason that isn't an option, tell us about it. Ideally, we can fix whatever issue you're having. Check out <a href="https://drawpile.net/help/">the main help page</a> for how to get in contact.

Otherwise, while it's not recommended to stick around on old, unsupported software, there's still servers that allow hosting with the old version. Most of the ones you can find <a href="https://drawpile.net/communities/">on the community servers page</a> still allow it. You can also <a href="/help/common/hosting#hosting-on-your-computer">host on your own computer</a>, with some network setup required, or set up <a href="/help/server/dedicatedserver">your own dedicated server</a>.
